# Meows & Games
### Hackbright x Optum Foundations Capstone Project

This is my foundations capstone project for the Hackbright x Optum cohort. Meows & Games is a full-stack web application that allows users to play amusing cat-inspired games. Users can view, rate, and add interesting cat facts, and they can play feline-esque versions of the classic Magic 8 Ball and Tic-Tac-Toe games.

### Tech stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- Cors
- Axios


### Features
- Users can view, rate, and add interesting cat facts on the cat-facts.html page. All cat facts are displayed on cards. Users can rate their favorite cat facts by clicking on the paw image, giving the fact(s) a "paws up," which is the rating system. Users can also add their own cat facts to the list by scrolling down to the bottom of the page, typing their cat fact in the text box, and clicking the "Add my cat fact!" button.

- Users can play a Magic 8 Ball inspired game on magic-cat-ball.html. Users come up with a "yes" or "no" question, and they can click the "Ask the cat" button to get a randomized answer from a fairly indifferent cat.

- Users can play a Tic-Tac-Toe inspired game on meow-tac-toe.html. Users can click on any of the 9 cells of the grid to begin the game. The user (player 1) will play as a calico cat, and the second user (player 2) will play as an orange and white cat. Different messages appear depending on which user wins. A draw is also possible. The results of the match will show on the screen when the game concludes.
