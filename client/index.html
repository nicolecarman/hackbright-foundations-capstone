            <p id="home-ptags">If you think cats are interesting creatures and you'd like to learn more about them, our <a href="cat-facts.html">Cat Facts!</a> database is a great place for you to start. You can peruse our database of cat facts and rate the ones you like by giving them a "paws up!" You can even add your own interesting cat facts by filling out the form at the bottom of the page. Others will be able to give your fact a "paws up" if they enjoyed reading your cat fact.</p>

            <p id="home-ptags">Did you grow up with the classic Magic 8 Ball novelty toy? If so, you're already familiar with how to play our version, which is a game we like to call <a href="magic-cat-ball.html">Magic Cat Ball</a>. Don't worry if you never had the opportunity to play. It's easy! All you do is ask the cat a "yes" or "no" question and you'll get a response from a fairly indifferent cat. He might ask you for treats, but we promise that he's already had his treats today!</p>

The first and primary player will play as a calico cat, and the secondary player will play as a ginger cat. Enjoy this twist on a classic family favorite! Remember what we said about the cat asking for treats...</p>
