            <p id="home-ptags">Did you grow up with the classic Magic 8 Ball novelty toy? If so, you're already familiar with how to play our version, which is a game we like to call <a href="client/magic-cat-ball.html">Magic Cat Ball</a>. Don't worry if you never had the opportunity to play. It's easy! All you do is ask the cat a "yes" or "no" question and you'll get a somewhat reasonable answer based on how the cat is feeling today.</p>

The first and primary player will play as a calico cat, and the secondary player will play as a ginger cat. Enjoy this twist on a classic family favorite!</p>
